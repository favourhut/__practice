            examples
    You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. For format, reference Docker’s AUTHORS page
    You should use branches and pull requests on GitHub - it will help you as team to organize your work

    [hbnb] Ask students to explain how importing packages in Python works. Make sure they mention the following concepts:

    Ask to explain how importing and packages work in Python: #0 possible syntax: from foo import bar, import bar
    Score (2 points): 1.9

    [hbnb] Ask students to explain how imports and packages work in Python: #1 when a file is imported it will be executed (Answer: yes and you can prevent that by putting if __name__ == “__main__” )
    Score (2 points): 2

    [hbnb] Ask students to explain what a package is (Answer: a package is a folder with a file init.py (this file can be empty))
    Score (2 points): 2

    [hbnb] Ask students to explain what a relative path is (Answer: a relative path is a “path” to a python file from where you import it)
    Score (2 points): 2

    [hbnb] Ask students to explain what an absolute path is (Answer: an absolute path is a “path” to a python file from where you start the Python interpreter)
    Score (2 points): 2

    [hbnb] Ask students to explain what cyclical importing is? (Answer: Cross importing of files)
    Score (2 points): 2

    [hbnb] Ask students to explain the flow of serialization/deserialization. Make sure they mention the following concepts:

    Ask students to give a quick definition of what serialization is (Answer: the concept of transferring data from one representation to another without losing any information)
    Score (2 points): 2

    [hbnb] Ask students Whether or not they can save an object on a hard drive after serializing it (Answer: can’t save an object on disk) (bytes)
    Score (2 points): 2

    [hbnb] Ask students to explain what kind of data representation is needed in order to serialize the object (Answer: you need to represent an object to a “simple structure”: dictionary)
    Score (2 points): 2

    [hbnb] Ask students to explain the flow of serialization/deserialization: #3 Specifically, how is a datetime object serialized/deserialized.
    Score (2 points): 2

    [hbnb] Ask students to explain what happens to a dictionary during serialization (Answer: with a dictionary, it’s possible to represent it as a string by using JSON)
    Score (2 points): 2

    [hbnb] Ask students to explain why we use JSON (Answer: JSON is a standard format to exchange data)
    Score (2 points): 2

    [hbnb] Ask students to explain what happens during deserialization (Answer: deserialization is the opposite of serialization: recreating an object based on a representation (dictionary, JSON file, etc.))
